# CLAUDE.md — Technical reference for the school quality project

This file is the technical reference for an AI agent (Claude Code) working on this
project. It documents the data, conventions, methodology decisions, and output
formats. For a human-facing overview, see `README.md`.

---

## What this project does

Analyses results of the Polish 8th-grade exam (**egzamin ósmoklasisty**) published
by the **Warsaw OKE district** and produces data for an external school-quality map.

**Critical scope fact:** the OKE Warszawa data covers **only the Mazowieckie
voivodeship** (1,663–1,720 schools depending on year), *not* all of Poland.
Always use **"voivodeship"** rather than "national" in code, comments, variable
names, chart labels, and markdown. For example: `voivodeship_mean`, not
`national_mean`; "Voivodeship median per year", not "National median per year".

If the data is ever extended to other OKE districts, the metric is still
well-defined per voivodeship, but the reference-computing functions should be
made parametric over the grouping level.

`data/` and `output/` are both singular mass nouns (input data / output data),
paralleling each other. `notebooks/` and `scripts/` are plural (countable files).

## Source data format

Each OKE xlsx has a sheet named `SAS` with a two-level header. After loading and
normalising (lowercase, strip Polish diacritics, collapse whitespace), the
relevant columns are:

**Metadata columns** (level-0 group is blank / "meta"):
- `rspo` — unique school identifier (stable across years)
- `nazwa szkoly` — school name
- `czy publiczna` — public/private flag
- `powiat - nazwa`, `gmina - nazwa`, `typ gminy` — administrative geography
- `miejscowosc`, `ulica nr` — address (used for geocoding)
- `wojewodztwo - nazwa` — always "Mazowieckie" (sanity-check this)

**Per-subject columns** (level-0 group is the subject name):
- `liczba zdajacych` — number of students who sat the exam
- `wynik sredni (%)` — mean score
- `mediana (%)` — median score
- (also `odchylenie standardowe (%)`, `modalna (%)` — not currently used)

Subjects present: `polski`, `matematyka`, `angielski`, and several minor foreign
languages (`francuski`, `hiszpanski`, `niemiecki`, `rosyjski`, `wloski`).

---

## Working DataFrame conventions

The notebook builds a flat `df` with one row per (school, year) and these columns:

- `rspo`, `year`, `school_name`, `is_public`
- `gmina`, `powiat`, `typ_gminy`, `miejscowosc`, `ulica_nr`
- Per subject `s`: `n_{s}`, `mean_{s}`, `median_{s}`
  (e.g. `n_polski`, `mean_matematyka`, `median_angielski`)

Only **3 core subjects** are usable for quality scoring: `polski`, `matematyka`,
`angielski`. The minor languages are taken by too few students per school to be
statistically meaningful (`core_short = ['polski', 'matematyka', 'angielski']`).

`ALL_YEARS` is the sorted list of years present in the data. `rspo_all_years` is
the set of schools with data in every year (used for stability analysis that needs
a constant fold population).

---

## The metric (final decision)

### Per-year, per-subject normalised score

```
diff_mean_year(school, subject, year) =
    school_mean(subject, year) − voivodeship_mean(subject, year)

unit_norm_diff_mean_year =
    diff_mean_year / (100 − voivodeship_mean)   if diff_mean_year ≥ 0
    diff_mean_year / voivodeship_mean           if diff_mean_year < 0
```

Range [−1, +1]: 0 = at the voivodeship mean, +1 = at the ceiling (100%),
−1 = at the floor (0%). In practice values rarely exceed ±0.5.

`voivodeship_mean(subject, year)` = mean of all schools' `mean_{subject}` in that
year (a per-year reference that neutralises exam-difficulty drift — e.g. the
Maths voivodeship mean jumped ~14 pp between 2021 and 2022).

### Aggregation across years

The per-school score aggregates the yearly values. **The aggregation method
depends on whether the metric is a baseline or an advanced one:**

| Metric | Aggregation across years | Why |
|--------|--------------------------|-----|
| `mean` (baseline) | arithmetic mean (equal weight) | simplest, for users who want a plain baseline |
| `median` (baseline) | arithmetic mean (equal weight) | same |
| `diff_mean` (advanced) | weighted mean by `n_students` | more evidence from larger cohorts |
| `unit_norm_diff_mean` (advanced, **primary**) | weighted mean by `n_students` | same |

This is encoded in `AGGREGATION_BY_METRIC` in the export section.

### Why `unit_norm_diff_mean` with weighted mean

Chosen by **leave-one-out (LOO) jackknife stability** testing: for each school
with ≥ 2 years, compute the score with each year left out; the metric whose LOO
estimates are closest together (lowest LOO standard deviation, normalised by the
metric's overall spread) is the most stable. Tested 8 per-year metrics × 5
aggregation methods. `unit_norm_diff_mean` + weighted-mean-by-n wins across all
subjects and school sizes ≥ 10 students, and the result holds on the larger
2022-onward population (1,297 schools, including small schools that started
reporting after 2021).

`diff_mean` and `unit_norm_diff_mean` correlate at Spearman 1.000 — identical
rankings, different scales. `diff_median` (median-based) is consistently *worse*
than `diff_mean`, because the median responds more violently to year-to-year
difficulty shifts (the median student moves the full shift, while the mean is
damped by floor/ceiling effects).

---

## Composite across subjects

```
composite_min(school) = min(
    unit_norm_diff_mean_polski,
    unit_norm_diff_mean_matematyka,
    unit_norm_diff_mean_angielski,
)
```

The **minimum** (not mean) of the three subject scores — answers "is this school
weak in *any* subject?". This is the **primary value shown on the map**.

`good_in_all_3` has been **removed** — do not reintroduce it.

The three subjects correlate ~0.7–0.8 (Pearson), so they are informative but not
redundant; the min captures the bottleneck subject.

---

## Colour scale (for the map)

Diverging green–yellow–red gradient, 5 classes, computed **per (metric, subject)**:

| Class | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| Saturated red | score ≤ centre − 1.5σ |
| Red | centre − 1.5σ < score < centre − 0.33σ |
| Yellow | centre − 0.33σ ≤ score ≤ centre + 0.33σ |
| Green | centre + 0.33σ < score < centre + 1.5σ |
| Saturated green | score ≥ centre + 1.5σ |

- **Per-subject scores**: centre = 0, σ = standard deviation across all schools.
- **`composite_min`**: centre = the empirical *mean* of composite_min (≈ −0.059),
  σ = its own standard deviation (≈ 0.245). This is **Option 1** from the
  methodology discussion — composite_min's distribution is shifted left (minimum
  of 3 draws is systematically below each draw), so 63.7% of schools have
  composite_min ≤ 0. Centring on the empirical mean gives a usable map where
  ~8.5% of schools reach saturated green, instead of <1% if centred at zero.

Empirical σ values (recomputed each run; these are indicative):
- polski ≈ 0.192, matematyka ≈ 0.284, angielski ≈ 0.361, composite_min ≈ 0.245

The **app defaults to `composite_min`** but exports all four views (3 subjects +
composite) so the user can toggle which subject colours the map.

## Notebook structure (`how_to_measure_school_quality.ipynb`)

- **0. Setup** — imports, `DATA_DIR`, `OUTPUT_DIR`, helper `render_min_highlighted_table`
- **1. Load data** — read all xlsx, build flat `df`, drop rows missing core subjects
- **2. Why only 3 subjects** — student-count distributions justify dropping minor languages
- **3. Choosing the best per-year metric** — the LOO stability analysis:
  - why the median jumps more than the mean (difficulty shifts)
  - within-school year-to-year swing vs voivodeship swing
  - candidate metrics + aggregation methods (joint LOO test, 8 × 5)
  - rank-swing analysis + the density-effect explanation
- **4. Final metric definition** — formulas, why, colour scale; subsection
  "Combining all three subjects" (correlation, composite_min, colour-class counts)
- **5. How school level and rank changes** — base vs LOO vs single-year views;
  lollipop charts for two samples (12 schools = 4 top/4 mid/4 bottom; 15 schools
  = 3 each at P10/30/50/70/90); population-wide scatter of range and min/max
- **6. Export data to external map** — computes alternative views, writes JSON + xlsx

### Helper: `render_min_highlighted_table(df, caption, value_fmt='{:.3f}', axis=1)`

Renders a DataFrame as an HTML table with the **minimum cell highlighted green**,
using **inline `<td style="...">`** (not a `<style>` block). This is required
because VS Code and nbconvert strip `<style>` blocks from notebook outputs, so
pandas `Styler.highlight_min` / `.apply` colouring does not survive. `axis=1`
highlights the min per row; `axis=0` per column.

---

## Export (Section 6)

### Views

For each (school, subject, metric), four **views** are exported — each computed
only over the **years the school actually has** (no meaningless folds):

| view_kind | view_param | meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `base` | — | score over all the school's years |
| `loo` | excluded year | score with one year left out (only if ≥ 2 years) |
| `single_year` | year | score from one year alone |
| `last_k` | k | score over the most recent k years, k = 2 … (n_years − 1) |

Each view carries `score`, `rank` (1 = best, among schools present in that view),
and `pct` (percentile).

### Output files

- **`schools-base.json`** (~1.2 MB) — loaded on map open. Metadata + primary
  (`unit_norm_diff_mean`) base score/rank/pct per subject + composite_min, plus
  `lat`/`lon` (from the geocoding cache; `null` if missing). Also `metadata.sigma`
  and `metadata.sigma_centre` for the colour scale.
- **`schools-{metric}.json`** × 4 (~8 MB each) — all views for all schools,
  loaded on demand when the user clicks a school or switches metric. `base` is a
  flat `{score, rank, pct}`; other views are `{param: {score, rank, pct}}` with
  integer-string param keys (`"2021"`, `"2"`).
- **`schools-{metric}.xlsx`** × 4 (~7 MB each) — long format for analysts, one row
  per (school, subject, view). Includes administrative metadata (powiat, gmina,
  typ_gminy) for filtering and pivots. Columns:
  `rspo, school_name, miejscowosc, ulica_nr, powiat, gmina, typ_gminy, is_public,
  n_years, metric, subject, view_kind, view_param, score, rank_overall,
  pct_overall, n_in_view`.

Naming: **English** for technical fields, **Polish** for geographic fields
(miejscowosc, ulica_nr, powiat, gmina, typ_gminy).

### Idempotence

`FORCE_REGENERATE = False` (top of Section 6). On each run the export compares
new data with the existing file and **skips writing if unchanged**, so git stays
clean on no-op runs:
- JSON: compares parsed payloads, ignoring `metadata.generated_at`.
- XLSX: reads the existing file (`dtype={'view_param': str}` to avoid `'2'`→`2.0`
  drift) and compares with `dataframes_equal` (floats via `np.isclose`,
  `rtol=1e-6`). `view_param` is written as text format so Excel doesn't coerce it.

`FORCE_REGENERATE = True` rewrites everything. `created` timestamps reflect the
real generation time when a file is actually written.

---

## Geocoding (`scripts/geocode_schools.py`)

Coordinates are **not** in the OKE data, so they are geocoded separately:

- **Input**: `output/schools-base.json` (rspo + address).
- **Cache**: `data/school_coords.csv` with columns
  `rspo, miejscowosc, ulica_nr, latitude, longitude`.
- **Logic**: if an rspo is in the cache and its address is unchanged, keep the
  cached row **in its original CSV position**; if the address changed, re-geocode
  in place; new schools are **appended at the end**.
- **Geocoder**: Nominatim (OpenStreetMap), 1.1 s between requests, tries
  "street, town, Polska" then falls back to "town, Polska".
- **Flags**: `--limit N` (cap new requests, for testing), `--force` (ignore cache).

Run it after adding new schools, then re-run the notebook's export cells so the
fresh coordinates land in `schools-base.json`.

---

## Global coding rules (apply everywhere)

- **Exact column names** — never substring-match (`df[f'mean_{s}']`, not
  `next(c for c in cols if 'mean' in c)`).
- **`pd.to_numeric(errors='raise')`** by default; use `'coerce'` only when
  non-numeric values are expected, and then assert/log how many were coerced.
- **Log dropped rows** with counts; never silently filter.
- **Assertions** for structural assumptions (e.g. RSPO unique per school name).
- **No `try/except`** to suppress errors during data loading.
- **Explore before analysing** — check shape/dtypes, `value_counts(dropna=False)`
  on key columns, cross-check related columns (if `n_students > 0`, verify
  mean/median are non-null); stop and report on unexpected nulls.

### Polish characters

Always preserve Polish characters literally in output: use
`json.dump(..., ensure_ascii=False)` and write files with `encoding='utf-8'`.

### Notebook outputs

Always **execute the notebook and embed outputs** (charts, tables) so results are
visible without re-running:

```bash
cd notebooks
uv run jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace how_to_measure_school_quality.ipynb
```

Run from the project root's `notebooks/` dir so the relative paths
(`../data`, `../output`) resolve. Warn before executing if long-running cells
changed (the export reads/writes several MB of xlsx).
